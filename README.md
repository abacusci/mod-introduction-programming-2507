## 📚 What You’ll Learn

This module guides learners through the essentials of programming using a text-based educational language (such as **Small BASIC**), with real examples and creative exercises.

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Understand what a program is and how computers interpret code  
- Write basic programs using **input**, **output**, **variables**, and **loops**  
- Use **conditions** and **repetitions** to control program behavior  
- Break down problems into logical steps and plan a solution  
- Create your own small, interactive projects using real code

## 🧩 Learning Approach

Classes follow a **project-based, hands-on** method. Every session combines:

- A short concept or demonstration  
- Guided practice with live examples  
- Independent challenges or small tasks  
- Reflection, planning, and peer feedback

Between sessions, students are encouraged to continue exploring, asking questions, and sharing progress through the online support channels.
